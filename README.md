# IA tool for UHI

This repo represent all the work that has been done on temperature prediciton. For the moment, it is not usable by someone who don't know anything about AI or computer sciences.
No input as CSV file are available here because they are huge, and not pushable on git. So if you want to extract data first, I recommend you to git clone this extraction app, and make an entire process to get a csv file of a city as an input data.
